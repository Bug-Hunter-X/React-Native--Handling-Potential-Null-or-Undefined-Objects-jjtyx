This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It happens frequently when dealing with asynchronous operations or data fetching where the data might not be available immediately.  For example, consider this code snippet:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text>  // Error here if user is null
    </View>
  );
};
```

If `fetchUser` hasn't completed yet, `user` will still be `null`, leading to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.
